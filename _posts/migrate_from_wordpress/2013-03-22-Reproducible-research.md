I have decided to adopt **Reproducible Research** in my research life recently after reading [blogs of Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/knitr/). Today I came across a very useful [blog of Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info/index.html). Essentially he promotes the same idea as Yihui but pushes it further to online publicated lab notebook. I believe the idea that bioinformaticians also need lab notebooks to keep track of everyday research. To maintain an electronic research notebook might be a good strategy to get ideas straight and keep records. You might want to check these two interviews of him (click [here](http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7434-711a) and [here](http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2010_04_09/caredit.a1000036)) to get a better idea. You might also want to check his [workflow](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/06/research-workflow.html) in using R for computational ecology researches.
