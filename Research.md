My main research interest is to apply statistical and computational methods to
analyze high dimensional biological data in cancer patients, the ultimate goal
of which is to identify new predictive or prognostic biomarkers and facilitate
the understanding the underlying mechanisms them.

 

-   Pathway Analysis of Drug Effects on Gene Expression in Different Tissues for
    genetically engineered mice carrying colon cancer

![Our proposed method IBPA identified more cancer related pathway level change in three relevant tissues compared with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)](<assets/images/research1.png>)

 

-   Survival Relevant Translational Signals in Tumor-adjacent-normal Tissues

 

![In different cancer cohorts in TCGA, adjacent normal tissues always provide complementary information towards survival prediction. ](<assets/images/research2.png>)

 

-   Drug Effects on Somatic Mutation Profiles in Circulating Tumor DNAs

![Our proposed somatic mutation calling method always gives the best ROC curve in terms of predicting the spiked-in mutation proportions (panel 1: 1%; panel 2: 0.5%; panel 3: 0.2%), simulating the real case of circulating tumor DNA samples](<assets/images/research3.png>)
