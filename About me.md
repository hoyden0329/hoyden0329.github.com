-   Hi there! My name is Xiu Huang. Welcome to my personal website and
    [blog](</archive.html>)!

-   I am a fifth year PhD student majoring in [Computational Biology and
    Bioinformatics](<http://cbb.yale.edu/>) at [Yale
    University](<http://www.yale.edu/>).

-   I am crazy about computer and biology. I think they each represent the
    top-notch products from manpower and mother natural.
