* Hi there! My name is Xiu Huang. Welcome to my personal website and [blog](/archive.html)!

* I am a fifth year PhD student majoring in [Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](http://cbb.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/).

* I am crazy about computer and biology. I think they each represent the top-notch
    products from manpower and mother natural.
